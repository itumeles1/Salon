# Responsive-static-webiste
This is a responsive website made purely using HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP.
It includes a style.css file that contains the styling, a media. queries.css file that is used to add some media queries as well, and an index.html file that contains the code.
The images used in this project are also available. All you have to do is download, unzip, and run index.html and you will see a responsive and static website.
